# Classroom Pricing FAQ

This article contains frequently asked questions around the classroom product pricing,
including what constitutes a student, as well as how the pricing was determined.

## What constitutes a student seat?

Student counts are based on _total unique monthly active students_. That's a mouthful
so let me break it down:

* Total: it doesn't matter how many classrooms you have; we will tally up all the
number of students across all your classrooms.
* Unique: a student is counted once, it doesn't matter if they're in multiple
classrooms.
* Monthly active: an active student is a student that submits something that
given month.

Please note that the amount billed is based on your maximum number of students, not
the number of students currently under your account.

## Why isn't this free?

Although most of our features are still free, we decided to charge for advanced
features so we can keep the lights on. The money we make will go to:

1. Staff: as of August 2018 we are 6 overworked human persons working on
Repl.it full-time. We try to keep a minimalist life-style but we still have to eat, sleep,
and use computers and that's where most of our money goes.

2. Infrastructure: we have to execute all your code somewhere -- in-fact, we
give each and everyone of our users dedicated, always-on Linux containers.

## Why did you just start charging as of August 2017?

We love what we do and the impact we have on our users -- programmers, learners,
and teachers alike. In fact, we self-funded this website for almost 5
years and up until last year it was something we could afford to do (after-all what's money
for if you can't use it for fun and good). However, last year we exploded in
popularity (partly thanks to our education products and partly our improved Repl
features). And so we had to quit our jobs and make this into a company (funded
by some amazing partners).

As we continue to grow in ambition, Google Cloud bills, and feature
requests, we decided to hire more people to help us. And that's what finally
convinced us that we need to make them dollars.

## What happens if I can't pay?

If you can't afford to pay and/or the organization you work for won't pay then
please get in touch with us. Especially if you're a user that's been with us for
a while we'll make sure to go out of our way to help you.

Similarly if you're an open-source project or organization we're happy to
accommodate you.

## If I exceed the limit but don't pay will I be locked out of my account?

We will make sure to give you ample time to make arrangements to pay. If you,
however, choose not to subscribe we will make sure that you have access to your
classrooms in at least read-only mode. Additionally, private classrooms will
remain private no matter what.

## How did you decide on the pricing?

1. We calculated how much money we needed to make ends meet and hire
enough people.
2. Then we guesstimated how many people would hopefully pay us.
3. Using advanced mathematics (long division) we deduced how much folks should
pay.

If you think our advanced market analysis techniques produced the wrong answer
then please let us know and we'll try to fix it.

## Anything else?

We love what we do, we love our users, and hope to continue to do it for the
foreseeable future. Please [support](/site/pricing) us in our endeavors.

## Are these questions really frequently asked?

Not really, but aren't most FAQs like that? (Is it okay for a FAQ to ask
questions?). We don't do this often.
