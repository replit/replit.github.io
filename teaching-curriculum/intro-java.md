> Hi, I'm Brendan McCart. I've been teaching school level computing science in Scotland for about 35 years, so when I learned to program at school I had to write FORTRAN code out on big squared sheets and got the output a week later! It is really inspiring and a privilege to be supporting the amazing young people in my school who are so passionate about developing their own CS skills and knowledge. I find the core CS principles I learned at university still hold and continue to power the fantastic opportunities that digital tech offers. CS education seems really exciting right now, with loads of innovation coming from a fusion of energy out of industry, academia and most importantly enthusiastic students and teachers. In Scotland, there is currently a growing wave of ambition for CS education and I'm pleased to see the contribution that dressCode, a charity I help with (led by the heroic Toni Scullion), is part of that. The Replit platform is an awesome fit for school-level CS education only matched by the amazing team who drive Replit forward and deliver for teachers and students.
