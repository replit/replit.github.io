# Importing Packages/Libraries

Importing packages and libraries can save you countless hours of coding. Instead of creating everything from scratch, just import already created files!

# How do I install packages?
To begin installing the packages you want, hover over the left side bar until you come across a cube name "Packages." Click on this button and begin seraching for the desired package(s) to download.

# How do I import Libraries?
To import a library, you can type the desired library right at the top of your code. In the example below, we imported the libary numpy which allows us to have access to data manipulation tools!
