## **Why are we doing this?**

Our mission at Repl.it is to make programming more accessible to all. We know this can be accomplished through multiple avenues and in partnership with the inredibly talented educators in our community, which is why we are now providing free curricula that educators are free to use, modify, and share alike when they are teaching Computer Science and Programming.

We will be introducing, updating, and creating a wide variety of curricula across multiple disciplines so make sure to check here often.

If you've found the curricula helpful, you want to create one yourself, or you have general feedback please reach out to us at contact@repl.it.

## **How does this work?**

Click on one of our curricula to the left, and just get started! You can use the curricula as is or modify them to fit your needs. If you'll be sharing modifications, they must be freely (non-commercially) shared and credit must be given to Repl.it and the specific curriculum creator. 

Happy teaching and happy coding!
