# **Intro HTML and CSS Curriculum**



## **Overview of Course**
Welcome to our Web Design course. We are providing you with a free set of pick up and play materials that include: course timeline, course outline, a high quality set of teaching slides, teacher notes and engaging activities with premade repl.it templates and teacher solutions. 

Learners will be introduced to the basics of HTML and CSS through a set of practical lessons that cover paragraph tags to divs and changing font colour to exploring gradient colour backgrounds. Each lesson will build learner knowledge of HTML and CSS and ends with an open team task. Learners are given the freedom to be creative and use their knowledge and the skills learnt throughout the course to create a website of their very own.

Feel free to use the curriculum as is or modify to fit your needs. If you share these materials (as is or with modifications), please provide attribution to Repl.it and Toni Scullion, who created the curriculum.

## **The Full Curriculum**

In this set of lessons, learners will explore the two core languages that are used to build web pages: Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). Learners will be introduced and explore basic HTML and CSS while also completing challenges and using the knowledge they will develop over the lessons to create their very own web design projects. They will be tasked with three debugging challenges allowing learners to apply their knowledge of HTML and CSS to identify and fix errors in code.
