# Using Multiplayer with Anonymous Users

As of right now, Multiplayer can only be used if you're signed into Repl.it. We are working on some solutions to allow for anonymous Multiplayer functionality, but in the meantime, here are the steps you should follow if you have an anonymous user who wants to collaborate with you. 

### 1. First, click share button in your repl.

### 2. Copy the join link in your repl.

### 3. Send your collaborator the join link.
They'll be redirected to the sign in page below:

### 4. After they sign in, they'll be redirected to back to repl as a collaborator!
