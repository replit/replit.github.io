`note:` .draw files are currently enabled for explorer users who have opted into experimental features


## Creating a draw file
Any file added to a repl with the extension .draw will be interpreted by the workspace as a drawing. 

.draw files are supported in all languages, and can be moved to any folder in your repl.

## Powered by Excalidraw
.draw files are proudly powered by [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw), an awesome open source library.

Excalidraw provides some additional documentation [here](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw#documentation)

### Keyboard shortcuts
the excalidraw library provides a wide variety of keyboard shortcuts to speed up navigation when drawing
