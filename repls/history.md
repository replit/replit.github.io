# Using Repl History
To help ensure you never lose work, Replit auto-saves your code as you write. If you ever lose an edit to your code that you'd like to recover, repl history is there to help.

## How to Access History
A repl's history is located at `https://repl.it/@username/repltitle/history`, but you can reach the same page by:
  - Choosing "History" from the three-dot menu for that specific repl (from the [My Repls](https://repl.it/repls) page) or
  - Clicking on the rewind button located in the top navigation bar inside the repl.

## Using History

A repl's history will show the individual changes to a file, in order from most recent. Clicking "change file" next to the file name will bring up a prompt to select the desired file. Selecting a file with a particular time and date will reveal the code differences between that revision and the latest code.

To restore a previous revision of code, select the desired revision and click "Restore" in the top-right corner of the screen.
