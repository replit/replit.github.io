# Repl from Repo

GitHub repositories can be run automatically on Repl.it. Head to https://repl.it/github to import a repository. Any public repository under 500 MB can be cloned, and subscribing to our [hacker plan](https://repl.it/pricing) unlocks private repos after authenticating with GitHub.

## Configuring your Repo

After cloning for the first time, you will be prompted to configure a run command for your repl. For more information, see [.replit documentation](https://docs.repl.it/repls/dot-replit).

## Adding a "Run on Repl.it" Badge

After configuring a run command for your repl, you can add a badge to your repository README that will allow anyone to run your project automatically!
