# Web Hosting

## Hosting a Web Site

Web Pages written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be hosted on Repl.it.

HTML/CSS/JS repls are hosted on Repl.it and given a unique URL that can be
shared with your friends, family, peers, and clients.  After running a repl,
your repl will be hosted at the URL provided in the `result` tab.

## URL Format

The repl will be hosted with the following URLs:
* `https://REPL-NAME--USERNAME.repl.co`
* `http://USERNAME.repl.co/REPL-NAME`
* `http://REPL-NAME.USERNAME.repl.co`

Where `REPL-NAME` is the name of the repl and `USERNAME` is the owner's username.
If an anonymous repl is created, the username used in the URL will be `five-nine`.

Note that if your username contains underscores `_`, they will be converted to dashes
in the URL.

## Updating Web Sites

Changes made to your repl will not be reflected in the live version until
the web project is re-run.  Running a web repl will update its live version.

Note that a repl's public link will persist, even after the repl has been deleted.
You can clear a repl of it's server code before deleting it in order to prevent it
from loading.

## Custom Domains
