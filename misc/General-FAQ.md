# **FAQs**

 This page should help answer some general queries but as always, if you need more information or are still confused please reach out to us at contact@repl.it 

## **Teachers**

##### **What is Teams for Education?** 

  It is the new product we have built out for all our teachers. We are transitioning from _Classrooms_ to _Teams for Education_ as it has a lot more features. Please check out our blog post [here](https://blog.repl.it/teams-for-education) to learn more.

## **Repls**

##### **Why isn't my repl loading?**

  It could be due to a few issues:

  1. Check if your browser has blocked javascript
  2. Make sure to disable any ad block software

  If none of these apply, please post your issue [here](https://repl.it/bugs/) along with the repl/s in question as well as browser information and operating system. You can always check and see if others have already raised a similar issue and just upvote and comment on that post.

##### **Why is my repl having display issues** 

  At times, the display can be buggy. The code may not run or, if it does, you get weird colors instead of your expected output. If this is the case please make sure your browser is up to date as this has been known to cause issues for some of our community members.

  
##### **What if my repl/s have been deleted?** 

  Here are a few simple steps you can do to retrieve your repl/s:

  1. Go to https://repl.it/~/cli.
  2. Once you get to the terminal, click "Trash".
  3. Choose the "View" option as it will list your most recently deleted repls.
  4. After you do this, you can go to "Trash" again but choose "Restore" this time along with the name of the project you want to restore.

##### **How do I fork a private repl?**

  You could invite your friend temporarily, allow them to fork, and then remove them from the repl via the share menu.

  You could download the repl as a .zip (this can be done by adding .zip to the end of your repl's URL), and send that copy of the code to your friend. They could then upload it to repl.it as their own repl.

##### **What if I have two repls in different folders and am unable to give them the same name?**


  Unforutnately the folders in the myrepls portion are more so metaphors and do not do much else. When you click on any repl it will always be https://repl.it/@username/repl_name which means all your repls need to be unique.

##### **How do I keep my repls to always stay on?**

As of July 2020 we have always repls in the works. In the mean time, you can use Keeper Upper as a work around. 

How does this work?
 - Need to keep your repl public
 - Go to this [website](https://keeper-upper.turbio.repl.co/) and login
 - Insert your repl into the input

Be wary; once your repl is on Keeper Upper it cannot be removed.

##### **How do I use repls in Keeper Upper?** 
 
 You just need to fork the repl in question and delete the original.

## **Account**

##### **I logged in with Gmail/Github etc. but want to change my email**

  1. Click on the top left where your username is (right next to the notifications icon). 
  2. Click on "Account", then go to the "My Account" section. 
  3. Click "Forgot password".
  4. You will receive an email with a link to create a new password. 
  5. After you create one, go back to the "My Account" section and update your email address to a new one by inputting the new password you created.

##### **Can you/we merge accounts?**

There are two ways that this can be done:

  1. The first method is manual and requires you to share every repl from your old account to your new one. Once you share all the repls, you would then fork each one on your new account. 

  2. The second way is to change the email address on the old account which should solve your problem (you also would not need to create a new account this way). This method will not be useful if you have already created an account with the new email.
