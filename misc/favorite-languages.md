 # Favorite Languages

![favorite languages dropdown](/images/misc/favorite-languages-dropdown.png)

Your favorite languages are a combination of the top three languages you selected as interested in and and the ones you use most often. You can update the languages you're interested in by visiting [repl.it/~/cli/account/languages?run=1](https://repl.it/~/cli/account/languages?run=1).

If you do not pick at least three languages, the remaining languages will be automatically chosen at random for you. For example, if you decide to only choose two languages, we will choose a third for you.
