# Explorer Mode

Some of our newer features are not yet available to everyone. If you want to be an 'explorer' -- someone who tries out the cutting edge of Repl.it -- you can find instructions below on how to opt-in.

Note that enabling these newer features before they are generally released might result in you discovering more bugs and other issues (which we'd love to hear about). You can disable explorer mode any time to revert to using our more stable features only.

## How to enable explorer mode

To enable explorer mode, navigate to [Your account settings](https://repl.it/account) and scroll down until you see the "Roles" section. Expand this and check the box next to "Explorer".

To disable explorer, simply uncheck the box again at any time.
