# Repl.it Docs

This is the repo for the [documentation](https://repl.it/site/docs) for [Repl.it](https://repl.it), a powerful online IDE.

# Contributing

To contribute to these docs, please feel free to create a pull request with changes to the docs.

If adding a new docs page, the markdown file should be placed in the appropriate folder (`repls`/`classrooms`/`misc`), and an additional entry should be added to the `sidebar.json` file.

The markdown files support the following HTML tags:
* `img`
* `iframe`
* `pre`
* `code`
* `div`
* `video`
* `source`

Though markdown is preferred whenever possible.  Most of these tags are used when specific styles (such as inline images) are needed.
