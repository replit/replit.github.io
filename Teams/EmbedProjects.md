# Embed Projects

To embed a project you will just need to follow the below steps:

1. Go to the three dot menu found at the right side of each project and click on.
2. From there copy the embed link.
3. Paste it wherever you are trying to embed the project and you should be good to go!

The embed code you copy will look like the below example:
