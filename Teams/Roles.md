# Team Roles

You can assign different members of your team different roles.

* **Member:** This is the default role and best for students or other people who don't need special access.
* **Admin:** This is for teachers, TAs, etc. It is meant for anyone who will be creating assignments and grading.
* **Billing admin:** This is for the person who created the team or anyone who will manage payments for the team.

You can assign roles to members who are part of your team by navigating to your [team dashboard](https://repl.it/teams) and choosing "manage members".
