# Team and Project Sharing

Teachers can now bulk copy and share projects to any Team. This feature is useful for a single teacher managing mulitple classes or sharing curriculum with your colleagues. Sharing and bulk copying is managed using a secure private link that is created by the team admin. 

The steps are laid out below:

1. Click on "share project" found right next to "create project":

4. This is the final link that you can share with others (you can edit). You are also able to create new links as needed (the old ones will not be removed), this will be useful if you want to share different projects with different people / teams. You are also able to delete the link so that it can no longer be used.
