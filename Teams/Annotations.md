## Annotations: Leaving Feedback on Projects

You can use **Annotations** to leave feedback on your students' work. Annotations can be added on projects and team repls. Annotations provide an easy way to give feedback on a specific line of code.

You can add an annotation to a repl by left-clicking on the specific line number where you want to leave the comment. A floating "annotate" button will appear by the line number. Left click on this button.

Alternatively, **right-click** anywhere on the line of code you want to comment on, and choose "Annotate" from the menu that appears.

A comment box will pop up towards the right of the code. Type in a comment and press the arrow on the right to save it.

The student who created the repl will receive an in-app notification as well as an email with your comment. They'll be able to reply to the comment or modify the code accordingly.

You can also use familiar markdown syntax in [annotations](https://blog.repl.it/annotations-for-education) and chat.

Here's a quick guide:
