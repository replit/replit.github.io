## Assignment creation and submission

From your team dashboard create a new template. After selecting a language and title, you'll be redirected to the IDE to add any comments, tests, and initial coding blocks you'd like your students to start from.

When your template is ready to be published, click "Publish template" from the IDE.

Students will be able to fork the template and create their own copy. Their copy will be private so that only the student and the team admins can see and edit their work. This keeps all student submissions private and prevents plagiarism.

When the students are done they click "submit" in the IDE header, which will notify all team admins of their submission.
