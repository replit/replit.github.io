## Inviting people to your team

Follow the steps during team creation to invite people with their repl.it username or email addresses.

If you've already created a team, go to the team dashboard and under "Teammates" click "Add more."

### Privacy invite links

In order to protect the privacy of students and remain in compliance, we've added a way to invite students to repl.it and your education team anonymously. This privacy invite method only works when signing up via a team invite link.

1. Go to your team dashboard, click "Add more" and click "Generate a team invite link"

2. Check the box next to "Do not collect names/emails"

3. On signup, students will be given an autogenerated username, and will not be required to enter an email, to register for repl.it. On successful signup, they will be automatically added to your team.
